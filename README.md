# advent-of-code-2019
I'm working on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems for 2019 in this repository.
The goal is to solve as many of the problems as possible, if not all of them, using Haskell. I first learned about it during 
my degree at Imperial College, but haven't used it much since besides occasionally doing the 
[January tests](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/ajf/haskell-tests/) for fun. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Haskell
and working with it - I'm not sure how much can be attributed to the, in my opinion, excellent Tony Field.

I'm most familiar with Java (with C++ a distant second and probably Python third), so working with Haskell can be quite 
frustrating in that I'm taking a long time for something I could conceivably implement in under 5 minutes.

I'll write up some of the thinking behind my solutions, as well as what I thought part 2 was going to be when I looked at the
part 1 spec for some of the problems.

## Day 1
Time taken: 25 minutes | Time I'd expect in Java: 3 minutes

Not much to say here, just a question of following the instructions. I think a good chunk of time here was just trying to
remember how to do IO. Part 2 had a fun solution of generating a lazily-evaluated infinite list of weight computations,
and then [applying takeWhile and sum](https://github.com/jeremyk-91/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/1/problem-1.hs#L14) on it.

## Day 2
Time taken: 30 minutes | Time I'd expect in Java: 10 minutes

We had a number of questions on custom interpreters back in uni. I used to find the syntactic sugar of having types
pointless, though I guess some experience in industry has made me value it more. Again, this felt like just a task of
following instructions. Some of the dereferencing code like `intCode!!(intCode!!(pointer + 1))` seemed horrible.

## Day 3
Time taken: 45 minutes | Time I'd expect in Java: 10 minutes

I went for the obvious solution of enumerating all points along the wires, taking the intersection of these points, and then
mapping Manhattan distance onto that. The first complexity issue popped out here: `List.intersect` is, of course, O(N^2) and
the wires covered around 10^5 points. I simply did a sort-and-merge based algorithm for an O(N log N) solution, which was
good enough; of course I would have just gone with `HashMap` and Immutables in Java to knock this out in linear time.

The real Part 2 was pretty easy, though it made me realise how much I missed things like `Maps.transformValues()` or
`foo.stream().map(function1).sorted(Comparator.comparingLong(longExtractor))`. In the end I decided to look at Haskell's
map library rather than messing around with sorted lists of key-value pairs.

### Jeremy's part 2 idea

> In part 1, the length of each segment of wire was bounded by 2<sup>10</sup>, and the length of each wire was bounded by
  2<sup>18</sup>. What happens if we changed these limits to 2<sup>63</sup> and 2<sup>63</sup> respectively? The number
  of components of each wire is bounded by 2<sup>10</sup>, still.
  
> Bonus: The number of components of each wire is bounded by 2<sup>20</sup>, not 2<sup>10</sup>: your algorithm
  cannot be quadratic in this.

I originally thought Part 2 would have forced you to do a more elegant geometry-based attack on this problem. Instead of
generating the full footprint of each wire, it would have been sufficient to generate a series of line segments, and then
test these for intersection. A na√Øve approach here of simply comparing each pair of segments would be quadratic in the
number of segments, but independent of the magnitude of the vectors.

An additional tricky bit here would be what to do with lines that are part of both wires. However, these can be handled
in constant time for each wire: if you have an axis-aligned line segment, the minimised Manhattan distance occurs either at 
the end of the segment nearest to the origin on the axis it's parallel to, or in the middle if it crosses zero in the axis.

The bonus version probably can be done with a sweep line style algorithm, which should be log-linear in the number of 
components.
